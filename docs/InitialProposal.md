# XX - Intelligent Command-Line Assistant

## Overview
`xx` is an intelligent command-line assistant that helps users execute complex commands by understanding their natural language intent. It acts as a safety layer between user intentions and command execution, providing suggestions and validations without direct command execution.

## Core Features

### 1. Natural Language Command Understanding
- Parse natural language input to understand user intent
- Support various command-line tools and their options
- Handle complex filtering and conditional operations
- Maintain context awareness across multiple commands

### 2. Command Proposal System
- Generate multiple viable command options based on user intent
- Rank proposals based on:
  - Command safety
  - Relevance to user intent
  - System impact
  - Historical usage patterns
- Display proposals with explanations and potential impacts

### 3. Safety Features
- Never execute commands directly
- Provide clear warnings for destructive operations
- Show command impact estimates (files affected, resource usage)
- Support dry-run simulations where applicable

### 4. Command Documentation Integration
- Real-time man page parsing and integration
- Dynamic help content aggregation
- Context-aware documentation snippets
- Support for custom command documentation

### 5. Output Analysis
- Store and analyze previous command outputs
- Use output analysis for better subsequent suggestions
- Support output-based filtering and transformation
- Enable command chaining based on previous results
- Maintain context awareness between commands
- Apply different analysis strategies based on command type:
  - Network traffic pattern analysis for tcpdump
  - Resource usage patterns for ps/top
  - Log correlation for system logs
  - Security threat detection across outputs
- Support for exporting analysis results in various formats
- Real-time analysis for long-running commands

## Use Cases

### System Administration
```bash
xx find "log files older than 30 days and compress them"
→ Suggests: find /var/log -type f -mtime +30 -exec gzip {} \;
```

### Network Diagnostics
```bash
xx tcpdump "show me all HTTP traffic to our API server"
→ Suggests: tcpdump -i any 'tcp port 80 and host api.example.com' -n
```

### Command Output Analysis
```bash
# Start packet capture with smart defaults
xx tcpdump
→ Suggests: tcpdump -i any -n -v

# After capture, analyze the output contextually
xx "look for malicious activity"
→ Analyzes previous tcpdump output and suggests:
  - Suspicious port scans detected from IP 192.168.1.100
  - Unusual UDP traffic patterns on high ports
  - Multiple failed connection attempts to port 22

# Further drill down into specific findings
xx "show all traffic from the suspicious IP"
→ Filters and formats the previous output for the specified IP

# Export findings for further analysis
xx "export suspicious activities to CSV"
→ Creates a structured report from the analysis
```

### Advanced Output Processing
```bash
# Process running analysis
xx ps aux
→ Suggests: ps aux --sort=-%cpu,-%mem

# Analyze process behavior
xx "find processes consuming unusual amounts of resources"
→ Analyzes output for anomalous resource usage patterns

# System log analysis
xx "correlate errors with high CPU usage"
→ Combines previous ps output with log analysis
```

### File Management
```bash
xx find "large video files I haven't accessed in 6 months"
→ Suggests: find ~/Videos -type f -size +500M -atime +180 -ls
```

### Process Management
```bash
xx ps "find memory hungry java processes"
→ Suggests: ps aux | grep java | sort -k4,4rn
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
xx grep "find error messages from today in all logs"
→ Suggests: grep -r "ERROR" /var/log --include=*.log --since="00:00"
```
